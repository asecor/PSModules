# PSModules

PowerShell modules which I put together to make my daily life easier for repetitive tasks. This is an ever-growing work-in-progress list.

**install-rdsbasic.psm1** - installs basic Remote Desktop Services Session Host & configures connectivity to a remote licence server

**getlocaladmin.psm1** - gets the members of the Administrators group on a local or remote environment

**format-sqldisk.psm1** - remotely looks for RAW disks, formats & configures it to be used as a disk for SQL DBs
